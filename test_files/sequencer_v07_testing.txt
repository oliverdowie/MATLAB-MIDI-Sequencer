MATLAB MIDI SEQUENCER_v07 testing

Version 7 changes all fprintf lines to my animText function for a better looking user experience!
Refinements to the note value conversion



INPUT FOR SEQUENCE LENGTH

same as version 6



INPUT FOR NOTE VALUES

the prompt now asks for values between 0 and 50 to narrow the note range to something a little more user friendly.

>> the input conditions have been changed to reflect this.
>> now anything outside of the range of 0 to 50 will re-prompt the user



NOTE CONVERSION

the 'notes' vector is input into the scaleRounder function and assigned to the global variable 'melody'.

>> the user note values are scaled up by 30 before being converted to prevent really low notes.

>> this has broken the silent notes as there are no values of 0 anymore!
