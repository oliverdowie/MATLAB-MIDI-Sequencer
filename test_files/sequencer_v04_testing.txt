MATLAB MIDI SEQUENCER_v04 testing

Version 4 introduces more robust user input for note value entry.


INPUT FOR SEQUENCE LENGTH - same as version 3

this input asks the user for the number of notes they want to enter.
there is no input checking yet.

>> non-number inputs will still produces errors
>> numbers <= 0 will still skip the note input stage and freeze the program requiring ctrl+c to break out of it.
>> massive numbers will cause the program to ask the user for massive amounts of note values! This still needs limiting!


INPUT FOR NOTE VALUES

i have discovered a much more robust way of checking user input for a number. the MATLAB function 'str2double', will take a string input, and if that string represents a number, it will convert it to a number. If it can't convert it to a number, it will output 'NaN'. This makes checking for numbers far easier and as far as I can tell, failsafe. I haven't been able to produce an error from input! with plain text, strings, character arrays etc, it will just produce 'NaN'.

>> input is checked to see if it is outside of the 0 to 100 range and if it is NaN.
>> if it is, the user is re-prompted with a secondary message asking for the input again.

>> if the user inputs a space between 2 numbers ie... '4 4', the program will re-prompt.
>> the re-prompt message will be changed to account for this. ie, "The value must be a 'single' number within the range of 0 -> 100
