MATLAB MIDI SEQUENCER_v01 testing

First goal is to get a working start/stop switch and speed control.

MIDI note values are predefined.

After researching callback functions and getting many errors, I have figured out that I can get it to work by putting the playback part of the script inside of the start/stop callback function.

The input arguments for the start/stop callback function will also accept the handle for the speed control callback function, allowing control over the playback speed.

It seems to work. Note numbers are printed to the command window as they are played.
