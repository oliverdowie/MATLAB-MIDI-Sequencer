MATLAB MIDI SEQUENCER_FINAL testing

Refinements to printed messages, extra input checking, fixed silent notes, fleshed out comments



INPUT FOR SEQUENCE LENGTH

implemented extra input checking. input for the number of notes is now limited to between 1 and 32
>> anything outside of this is will re-prompt the user



INPUT FOR NOTE VALUES

same as version 7 - rather robust



NOTE CONVERSION

the 'notes' vector is input into the scaleRounder function and assigned to the global variable 'melody'.

>> the user note values are scaled up by 30 before being converted to prevent really low notes.
>> values that were 0 are now 30, so values of 30 are replaced with 0 to make silent notes work again!


everything seems to be working quite well. I haven't been able to break it yet.
