MATLAB MIDI SEQUENCER_v03 testing

Version 3 introduces user input for note values.

The vector for the note values is made a global variable so it can be accessed from within the startStop callback function.


INPUT FOR SEQUENCE LENGTH

this input asks the user for the number of notes they want to enter.
there is no input checking yet.

>> non-number inputs will produces errors
>> numbers <= 0 will skip the note input stage and freeze the program requiring ctrl+c to break out of it.
>> massive numbers will cause the program to ask the user for massive amounts of note values! This needs limiting!


INPUT FOR NOTE VALUES

this input asks the user for note values for the number of notes they wanted to enter.
there is input checking, but it still produces errors!

>> a number outside of the range 0 - 100 is checked and re-prompted

>> code is meant to check for blank values and non-number values, but it produces ERRORs!
>> error is due to array dimension mismatching for some reason
