MATLAB MIDI SEQUENCER_v06 testing

Version 6 implements silent notes for note values of 0, as well as conversion of note values into the C major scale.


INPUT FOR SEQUENCE LENGTH

same as version 5



INPUT FOR NOTE VALUES

same as version 5



NOTE CONVERSION

the 'notes' vector is input into the scaleRounder function and assigned to the global variable 'melody'.

>> user input range for note values needs to be made narrower. currently the range of 0 to 100 produces very low and very high notes, which are not very user friendly!



SILENT NOTES

in the for loop that cycles through the notes values, the note values are checked for a value of 0.

>> if a note is 0, the MIDI velocity for that note is set to zero, which plays a silent note.
