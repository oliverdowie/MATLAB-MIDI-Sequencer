MATLAB MIDI SEQUENCER_v05 testing

Version 5 introduces user input checking for all inputs using the str2double function and while loops.


INPUT FOR SEQUENCE LENGTH

this input asks the user for the number of notes they want to enter.

>> input checking fairly failsafe by using str2double to force a number or NaN, then checking
>> this input is still accepting any number. this needs limiting to only accept reasonable numbers!


INPUT FOR NOTE VALUES

same as version 4
