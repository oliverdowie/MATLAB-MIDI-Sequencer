MATLAB MIDI SEQUENCER_v02 testing

This was an attempt to generate audio within MATLAB, to avoid using external software for MIDI.

I researched ways to generate audio in MATLAB, but found it a little out of my skill range. This script uses an idea from the audioOscillator function documentation. But it sounds really average and somehow breaks the start/stop functionality.

I was unable to generate any audio other than harsh sounding beeps.

I decided that using MIDI was a much more effective way to go.
